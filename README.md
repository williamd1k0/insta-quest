**Take beautiful pictures and get the most out of likes and fans!**

A game inspired by WarioWare's microgames style. Your goal is to take a good picture in each microgame. A hint will appear and you will need to figure out what to do in the microgame.

Use d-pad (arrow keys) to move when needed and R1/A (Space) to take pictures at the right time.

Be careful, you can take bad pictures for only 3 times!
